This is something any engineer might say. What a typical engineer might neglect though, is to think about ways to incorporate sleek looks into a design. This is where I place myself as a designer. <strong>I am interested in blending robust and effective engineering solutions with eye-pleasing aesthetics</strong>. For this reason, I see the expertise areas of Technology &amp; Realisation and Creativity &amp; Aesthetics to be the most fascinating and valuable for my future career.&nbsp;<br><br>As outlined in the section describing my past, the activities I undertook in high school allowed me to pick up the <strong>harder engineering skills</strong> such as modelling in CAD and understanding how to use software to create and execute a design with robust construction that fulfils specific functions. The courses of the first year of ID, on the other hand, complemented this knowledge by teaching me about the <strong>importance of the design process</strong>, the cycle of analysing, ideating, developing, and executing a design. I find myself now much more confident in being able to<strong> evaluate</strong> the <strong>feasibility of a design</strong> as well as be able <strong>to account for the needs and desires</strong> of consumers and/or society as a whole.&nbsp;<br><br>While I am already competent in <strong>T&amp;R</strong> and some aspects of <strong>C&amp;A</strong>, which I was able to verify during the first-year projects, I discovered about myself a new desire to <strong>learn about</strong> <strong>entrepreneurship and the business aspect of design</strong>. My dream is to <strong>start a company</strong> that brings <strong>technological innovation</strong> to the market. However, I do not have much formal education in the area, with the Economics course in high school being the only notable example. Therefore, I want to support my curriculum with courses focused on the expertise area&nbsp;<strong>Business and Entrepreneurship</strong>.<br><br></p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;max-width: 100%;">For this reason, one of my biggest role models is&nbsp;<strong>Christian von Koenigsegg</strong>, a Swedish founder and CEO, who was able to breach the difficult-to-enter automotive industry in 1994 with his company Koenigsegg,&nbsp;bringing excellent design and a number of innovations to the industry. This includes the introduction of carbon fibre chassis, a unique way of opening the doors of his cars or the Triplex suspension system, to name a few. What inspires me about Koenigsegg is that he is&nbsp;<strong>not just a CEO</strong>&nbsp;but also the person responsible for many of the&nbsp;<strong>patented innovations</strong>&nbsp;of his company and is&nbsp;<strong>actively involved in the design</strong>&nbsp;of his vehicles. I would like to&nbsp;<strong>breach the industry</strong>&nbsp;(not necessarily automotive)<strong>&nbsp;in a similar way&nbsp;</strong>one day.<br><br></p>

                <div style="margin-top: 53px;">

                    <div class="bar" style="background: #004e79;height: 4px;margin-bottom: 15px;"></div>
                    <p class="p-justified" style="text-align: justify;">I look forward to a bright future for humanity, but I expect that the current world situation will create new challenges that will demand us to change the way we live as a society.&nbsp;<br><br>Firstly, with rising energy prices,<strong> people are more energy-conscious</strong> now than ever before. I see this personally with my family, who invested in solar panels and started to find many creative ways to reduce electricity consumption. This societal trend will create a <strong>demand for energy-efficient designs</strong> and will shape the direction products and systems are designed in the nearest future. Designers who do not take this into account will likely see their projects fall short.<br><br>Secondly, the world's population is growing rapidly in some areas and ageing in others. This leads to an <strong>increased demand for food in developing countries</strong> and fewer available workers in more developed ones. I believe the solution to the former problem is a <strong>better use of farming space</strong> through building <strong>vertical farms</strong> that utilize <strong>hydroponics</strong>. The latter problem can be addressed with <strong>robotics</strong>. These two technologies can be combined to create sustainable and efficient farming that is not labour intensive. Given that I involved myself in the robotics club in high school, and like to grow plants as a hobby, I can see myself exploring this direction as my <strong>possible future focus</strong>.<br>&nbsp;<br>In terms of industrial design itself, I see<strong> CAD</strong> (Computer-aided design) becoming an even more prominent technology. Even though CAD has been a key part of industrial design for decades, I see CAD software that uses <strong>cloud technology</strong> as the future, since it makes design <strong>collaboration across distance</strong> much faster and easier. That is why I still lean towards using cloud-based Autodesk Fusion 360 rather than the much more established and more capable SolidWorks.<br><br>Another area I find fascinating and see a lot of potential in is <strong>additive manufacturing</strong>, as 3D printing has been my interest since I was 15.&nbsp;While the technology is ideal and well-used from the prototyping standpoint, I believe it will also gain prominence <strong>outside of prototyping</strong>, especially with the <strong>AI design capabilities</strong> now available. One of the main reasons for this is that I see the trend of <strong>personalisation of products</strong> becoming more important. Brands will be able to appeal to their customers’ specific wants and needs without drastically raising the costs. This can be a custom shape or pattern on a product or a more complex item such as a prosthetic limb or custom-fit wearable gear, such as skiing shoes. With additive manufacturing, it is possible to <strong>adjust the product to perfectly fit the customer’s body or preferences</strong>.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
