# Petr Dobias — Portfolio

This repository powers the static portfolio site for Petr Dobias. It combines case studies, experiments, and interactive tools deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Title Forge — Text Vibe Lab
Title Forge is a new addition that lets you compose eccentric SVG title graphics in the browser.


- **Stack:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with dynamic SVG rendering.
- **Highlights:**
  - Live preview with gradient fills, glow, drop shadow, and wave distortion filters.
  - Curated presets plus the ability to save personal presets in local storage.
  - SVG export via copy-to-clipboard or download with clean markup.

- Contributions should maintain the neon editorial aesthetic captured in Title Forge.
