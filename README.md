# Petr Dobias — Portfolio

This repository powers the static portfolio site for Petr Dobias. It combines case studies, experiments, and interactive tools deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Title Forge — Text Vibe Lab
Title Forge is a new addition that lets you compose eccentric SVG title graphics in the browser.

- **Page:** [`main/vibecoding/SVG Page Title Generator/title-lab.html`](./main/vibecoding/SVG%20Page%20Title%20Generator/title-lab.html)
- **Stack:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with dynamic SVG rendering.
- **Highlights:**
  - Live preview with gradient fills, glow, drop shadow, and wave distortion filters.
  - Curated presets plus the ability to save personal presets in local storage.
  - SVG export via copy-to-clipboard or download with clean markup.

Consult the [creative brief](./main/vibecoding/SVG%20Page%20Title%20Generator/title-generator-brief.md) and [user guide](./main/vibecoding/SVG%20Page%20Title%20Generator/title-forge-user-guide.md) for more context.

## Development Notes
- No build tooling is required; open the HTML files directly in a browser.
- Title Forge assets live under `main/vibecoding/SVG Page Title Generator/` alongside the HTML, CSS, JS, and docs.
- Contributions should maintain the neon editorial aesthetic captured in Title Forge.
